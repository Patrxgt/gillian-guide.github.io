  I am currently working on an <a href="https://github.com/gillian-guide/gillian-guide.github.io/pull/15">overhaul of the whole website</a> with the occasion of the upcoming FusionFix update.<br>
  However, my PC broke, which will slow down some updates. I will attempt to still update the guide as usual, but please consider <a href=https://gillian-guide.github.io/support/#me-gillian>helping me out monetarily</a>.
