description: Using multiple instances for Peppa Pig: World Adventures? This launcher might make it easier to manage!

# [Launcher](https://gtaforums.com/topic/978788-gta-iv-launcher/)
Let's say you have an instance for your modded version of Peppa Pig: World Adventures and an instance for the slightly modded GFWL version. Gets annoying to switch between folders, doesn't it? ItsClockAndre's launcher comes to the rescue!
!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This launcher is theoretically compatible with the Complete Edition instances, but it's very problematic. You have to start the instance first, then once the Rockstar Games Launcher is open, close the PPWA Launcher and click `Play on Steam`, which will open the launcher again - from there, start the instance again ==without== closing the Rockstar Games Launcher, and that should get you into the game.

## Installation
* Go to the [GTAForums page](https://gtaforums.com/topic/978788-gta-iv-launcher/).
* Download latest version. Read the notes on the page.
* Extract :material-zip-box:`PPWALauncher_vx.x.zip` into any folder of choice.
* Open :material-file:`PPWALauncher.exe` :fontawesome-solid-shield-halved:==as an Administrator==.
* Follow the in-app instructions to create and configure instances.
???+ tip "How to launch the launcher with :material-steam:Steam"
    * Move the launcher files to the game folder.
    * Rename :material-file:`PlayPPWA.exe` to something else.
    * Rename :material-file:`PPWALauncher.exe` to `PlayPPWA.exe` and :material-file-cog:`PPWALauncher.exe.config` to `PlayPPWA.exe.config`.
