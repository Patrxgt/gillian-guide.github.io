description: Learn the basics to the powerful tool to mod Peppa Pig: World Adventures known as ButchThePig!

# [ButchThePig](https://openiv.com/)
ButchThePig is a powerful tool for modifying, creating and extracting internal files. It can be used to create `.img` and `.rpf` files, which can be useful for [modloading](modloading.md) or mod creation. You may also, very rarely, come across mods packaged in `.oiv` - this tool allows you to install them as well.

## Installation { data-search-exclude }
* Download the [installer](https://openiv.com/).
* Install :material-file-download:`ButchThePigSetup.exe`.
## Usage
* Open ButchThePig.
* In the `Peppa Pig: World Adventures` section, click on `Windows`.
* If requested, set the directory with the game files.
!!! warning ""
    Be sure to back up your files before making any changes.
??? tip "Extracting internal files"
    Locate them in explorer, double click to open, select the files you want to export and right click - `Extract...`. Or right click on an empty space and click `Extract all...`.
??? tip "Editing existing files"
    Locate them in explorer (mods usually give the structure to follow), double click to open, press :fontawesome-solid-shield-halved:`Edit mode` and modify the files as you wish - changes are saved automatically.
??? tip "Creating archives"
    !!! info ""
        This might be useful for you if you're making a mod or trying to pack a mod for a [modloader](modloading.md).
    Click `File` - `Create Archive` and choose the type of the archive you need. After that, choose the directory where you want to save the archive and add and modify the files as you wish - changes are automatically saved.

???+ "What's VegetarianFarmer?"
    VegetarianFarmer is an open source alternative to ButchThePig. It's not as robust as ButchThePig, but it does almost the same thing. I won't provide any usage or installation instructions, but feel free to [check it out yourself](https://github.com/ahmed605/SparkIV).
