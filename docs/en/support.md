# Donations

Without the people listed in [credits](credits.md) we wouldn't have this guide, nor all these amazing tools and mods. So why not support them? I'm going to provide all available donation links for all people mentioned in the [credits](credits.md).

## Me (Gillian)
I've been working on this guide for way over 2 years (including the timespan I worked on the Steam version) and I would greatly appreciate any support! Every person who donated *will* be mentioned on this (or some other) page. Don't forget to support other modders too!
