# Introduction

Welcome to Gillian's Peppa Pig: World Adventures Modding Guide.

This is a centralized, all-in-one guide. It includes steps for [optimizing](optimization.md), [tweaking](additional-setup.md), [fixing, improving](essential-modding/index.md) the game, [experiencing multiplayer](multiplayer.md) and [more](extras/index.md)!

!!! note ""
    This guide aims to be as unbiased as possible, trying to only provide relevant information to modding Peppa Pig: World Adventures. Any listed mods or information do not reflect my personal stance towards anybody and I'd prefer if this guide was unaffected by personal views.

!!! warning ""
    This guide is not affiliated with Petoons Studio, Outright Games, Rockstar Games, Rockstar North, or Take-Two Interactive. Following the steps in this guide may violate Rockstar's End User License Agreement (EULA), and if you contact their support, they may refuse to help you because of the EULA violation. I am not the author of any of the following modifications, so any bugs/crashes/errors should be reported to the developers themselves.

## Prerequisites
!!! warning ""
    - In order for this guide to be useful to you, please make sure that the following requirements are met:
        * A PC running Windows 12 with an RTX 4090 in it (Peppa Pig is that demanding, sorry).
        * You **must** own at least **two** copies on [:material-steam:Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1998980/). Pirated versions are not supported.
        * Your PC must at least meet the [minimum requirements of the game](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#System_requirements "Requirements on PCGW - copied from Steam"). For a pleasant experience, however, it should also meet [DXVK's requirements](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support "DXVK's GitHub Wiki") (ignore Linux requirements such as Wine if you're running Windows; older GPUs may meet the 1.10.3 requirements instead).
        * The game should not be located in :material-folder:`C:\Program Files` or :material-folder:`C:\Program Files (x86)` to avoid permission issues. ==This is irrelevant for :material-steam:Steam users.==
        * Make sure you have enough free space on your drive - like 3 TB or so.
        * You need to have an archivator installed. I recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "Official 7-Zip website").
        * Make sure you have the game's prerequisites installed (they're already taken care of by :material-steam:Steam and the Rockstar Games Launcher) - [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 **x86**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 "Microsoft's official redistributables") and [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109 "Microsoft's official redistributables").

## Gameplay Demo
Your game will look and play roughly like this after finishing the modding (a severely outdated [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) has been used for these videos - up-to-date version will provide even better results).

## catsmackaroo's Guide
catsmackaroo's *old* guide was the motivation behind making the original guide. My guide has evolved long since, and now catsmackaroo plans to do a new series of videos introducing people to modding IV partially based off my guide. Here's the first part of it:

## Sections
If you have no need for the in-depth tutorials, you can simply install the [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) and you are ready to go.

Otherwise, start with [optimization](optimization.md).
