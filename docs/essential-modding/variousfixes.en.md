# Various Fixes
!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This mod can work with any patch.
This project aims to fix or improve a large amount of map issues and textures. You can see the changelog on the [GTAForums thread](https://gtaforums.com/topic/975211-various-fixes/).

## Installation { data-search-exclude }
    * Make sure you have [FusionFix](fusionfix.md) installed.
    * Go to the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nLq3uiw1XFW5lrIwdSLuk2ZhpEWzdLw0).
    * Download the :material-folder:==update== from `Installation through Fusion Overloader`.
    * Extract the folder into the game folder. Replace files if prompted.
    * You may also install some things from the `Optional Content`, but that will require you to use [OpenIV](../extras/openiv.md) to add the files to the existing `.img` file.
    ???+ question "Other installation methods"
        You can also go through with the manual or auto-installation, but it's frankly more unnecessary effort and harder to make to work with other mods than using this.
